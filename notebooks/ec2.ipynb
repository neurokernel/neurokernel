This notebook assumes that you have already setup an account on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and that you are able to start an Amazon EC2 Linux Instance. For detailed tutorial on starting an Linux Instance, see [Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Linux Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html). AWS currently provide free tier for new users for one year on t2.micro instances. If you have not used AWS before, you can try starting an linux instance free of charge to familiarize yourself with the cloud computing service.\n",
